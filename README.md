terraform-az-demo-1 Terraform Azure

A demo using Check Point CloudGuard to protect a simple website (version R80.20)
Builds the manager and the gateway separately using the ARM templates from the marketplace
The built environment is similar to the CloudGuard BootCamp and CCVSA labs

Once built login to the mangager and add the gatway object and push policy 
Tested with terraform 0.11

This is a work in progress and is not officially supported by Check Point
